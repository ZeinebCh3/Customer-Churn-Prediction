## **Project Overview**
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company's services. Understanding churn is critical for businesses to retain valuable customers. This project covers:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure and patterns in the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building a machine learning model to predict churn likelihood.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used is the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset, containing various features about customer demographics, account information, and service usage.

### **Key Features**
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 or 0).
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner.
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents.
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- **Contract**: Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- **Churn (Target)**: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).
